## =====GUESS THE NUMBER=====
This repository contain my C programming assingnment.

I made a game using C programming Languange. In this game system will choose a number between 1 to 100 you have to guess this no.

# FILES REQUIRED
stdio.h

stdlib.h

time.h

# HOW GAME WORKS
The system already chooses a number between 1 to 100 and you have to guess it

If your guess number is smaller than choosed number it will return "TOO LOW. TRY AGAIN".

If your guess number is larger than choosed number it will return "TOO HIGH. TRY AGAIN".
