## =====GUESS THE NUMBER=====
This repository contain my C programming assingnment.

I made a game using C programming Languange. In this game system will choose a number between 1 to 100 you have to guess this no.

# FILES REQUIRED
stdio.h

stdlib.h

time.h

# HOW GAME WORKS
1. The system randomly chooses a number between 1 to 100 

2. You enter a number to guess it

3. The program will guide you:
   If your guess number is smaller than choosed number it will return "TOO LOW. TRY AGAIN".

   If your guess number is larger than choosed number it will return "TOO HIGH. TRY AGAIN".

4. When you finally guess the correct number:

5. It displays a success message with the total attempts you took

# FEATURES

1. Random number every time you play

2. Unlimited attempts until the correct answer

3. Shows hints to help the player guess correctly

# PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM

This assignment helped me learn:

1. Random number generation using srand and rand

2. Loops and condition checking

3. User input handling in C

4. Basic game development logic

# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM

Save the file as guess_number.c

Compile using GCC (example):
